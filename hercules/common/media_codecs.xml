There's a simple and a complex syntax to declare the availability of a
media codec:

A codec that properly follows the OpenMax spec and therefore doesn't have any
quirks and that only supports a single content type can be declared like so:

    <MediaCodec name="OMX.foo.bar" type="something/interesting" />

If a codec has quirks OR supports multiple content types, the following syntax
can be used:

    <MediaCodec name="OMX.foo.bar" >
        <Type name="something/interesting" />
        <Type name="something/else" />
        ...
        <Quirk name="requires-allocate-on-input-ports" />
        <Quirk name="requires-allocate-on-output-ports" />
        <Quirk name="output-buffers-are-unreadable" />
    </MediaCodec>

Only the three quirks included above are recognized at this point:
