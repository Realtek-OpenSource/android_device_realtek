    <!-- Device configuration setting the minfree tunable in the lowmemorykiller in the kernel.
         A high value will cause the lowmemorykiller to fire earlier, keeping more memory
         in the file cache and preventing I/O thrashing, but allowing fewer processes to
         stay in memory.  A low value will keep more processes in memory but may cause
         thrashing if set too low.  Overrides the default value chosen by ActivityManager
         based on screen size and total memory for the largest lowmemorykiller bucket, and
         scaled proportionally to the smaller buckets.  -1 keeps the default. -->

    <!-- Package name(s) containing location provider support.
         These packages can contain services implementing location providers,
         such as the Geocode Provider, Network Location Provider, and
         Fused Location Provider. They will each be searched for
         service components implementing these providers.
         It is strongly recommended that the packages explicitly named
         below are on the system image, so that they will not map to
         a 3rd party application.
         The location framework also has support for installation
         of new location providers at run-time. The new package does not
         have to be explicitly listed here, however it must have a signature
         that matches the signature of at least one package on this list.
